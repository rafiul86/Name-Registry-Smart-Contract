<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Front-running and malicious node/validator resistant smart contract, written in Solidity to register vanity names/domains on EVM Blockchains.
An unregistered name can be registered for a certain amount of time by locking a certain balance of an account. After the registration expires,
 the account loses ownership of the name and his balance is unlocked. The registration can be renewed by making an on-chain call to keep the 
 name registered and balance locked. The fee to register the name depends directly on the size of the name. Also, a malicious node/validator 
 should not be able to front-run the process by censoring transactions of an honest user and registering its name in its own public address.
