<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Inspiration

Blockchain technology enables decentralized applications (DApps) or smart contracts. Function calls (or transactions) to the DApp are processed by a decentralized network. Transactions are finalized in stages: they (generally) first relay around the network, then are selected by a miner and put into a valid block, and finally, the block is well-enough incorporated in the blockchain that is unlikely to be changed. Front-running is an attack where a malicious node observes a transaction after it is broadcast but before it is finalized, and attempts to have its own transaction confirmed before or instead of the observed transaction.

In this application I followed Consensys provided guideline to prevent frontrun and malicious activities by validator. Suggestion is to store 
the keccak256 hash of the data in the first transaction, then reveal the data and verify it against the hash in the second transaction. 


## About The Project

Front-running and malicious node/validator resistant smart contract, written in Solidity to register vanity names/domains on EVM Blockchains.
An unregistered name can be registered for a certain amount of time by locking a certain balance of an account. After the registration expires,
 the account loses ownership of the name and his balance is unlocked. The registration can be renewed by making an on-chain call to keep the 
 name registered and balance locked. The fee to register the name depends directly on the size of the name. Also, a malicious node/validator 
 should not be able to front-run the process by censoring transactions of an honest user and registering its name in its own public address.
